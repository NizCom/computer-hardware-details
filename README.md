The project prints your computer's hardware details in a table.
You also have the option to insert a size unit showing the RAM usage, etc.

The project is combined of 3 py files:
1- computer_hardware_details: The main file.

2- functions: Holds the logical functions including checking validation.

3- functions_on_table: Holds the functions that we run on the table including inserting details into it and printing the table.


In addition, there's a "requirements.txt" file which holds the libraries and their versions that are needed for running the program.
